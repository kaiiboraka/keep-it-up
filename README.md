# Fall 2024 Game Jam - Keep it Up

ideas

Castle keep   
"TOWER" defense - against what?   
Build it higher - why?   
	- Specific parts of tower have features   
	- Stability componentâ€¦ quality, worth, value, tier, attractiveness to monster attacks   
Multiple Towers?   
Resources? Gold mine, passive income? Needs to be defended, upgraded   
Weather, random attacks and things destroying   
Higher tiers produce more capable units, better able to fight enemies that fly higher up    
Tower builds from wide base to narrow top, when a section of the tower is destroyed the whole thing falls down? Until the section is rebuilt and the rest of the tower gets raised up again
